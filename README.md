# üöá Pune-Metro-Route-Optimization-System

---

The Pune-Metro-Route-Optimization-System is an intelligent web-based application designed to streamline urban travel by providing efficient route planning within a simulated metro/bus network. It helps users discover the shortest paths, estimate travel times, and calculate fares, making daily commutes more predictable and convenient.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities

This system offers intuitive tools to optimize your journey:

### 1. Route Planning

* **Source & Destination Selection:** Users can easily select their desired starting point and final destination from available transit hubs.
* **Optimal Path Calculation:** Utilizes **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the most efficient route (based on distance) between the selected points.

### 2. Travel Estimation

* **Distance Calculation:** Provides the total distance of the optimized route in kilometers.
* **Time Estimation:** Estimates the approximate travel time in minutes for the suggested route.
* **Fare Calculation:** Computes the estimated fare based on the calculated distance.

## üîë Key Features

* **Efficient Pathfinding:** Implements a robust Dijkstra's algorithm to ensure the discovery of the shortest and most efficient routes.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for a clean, user-friendly, and interactive web application experience.
* **Comprehensive Trip Details:** Offers a complete overview of the journey, including path, distance, time, and fare, at a glance.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents common errors by prompting users if the source and destination selected are identical.
* **Modular Design:** The project's structure (separate modules for graph data, pathfinding logic, and utilities) promotes maintainability and scalability.
